Fortunately, technology has advanced to the point of creating equipment that makes doing even the biggest and most complex quilt easier than ever.  For many quilters, a mid-arm machine such as the Qnique Quilter works best for their projects.  Allowing for work on projects that earlier would have required a long-arm machine, these machines offer a variety of features that make sewing even the most complex quilt a pleasure.</p>
