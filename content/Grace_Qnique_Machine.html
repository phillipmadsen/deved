<h2>A Quilting Machine with Numerous Features is Necessary</h2>

<p>Many quilters today want to make bedcovers for larger mattress sizes such as queen or king, leading to needing bigger quilt squares. Stitching on larger squares of fabric is easier with a mid-arm machine with a bigger working space to maneuver the material quickly. Instead of needing to stop and start the sewing machine often to rearrange fabric, the seamstress can rotate the squares while stitching. Not only is this maneuverability a great feature while making individual squares, it is also helpful when stitching on borders, fillings and backings of quilts. The engineers who designed the Grace Qnique Machine have thought of everything, including:</p>
